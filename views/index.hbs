  <p>Hello, I'm Trey! Welcome to my personal website where you can view some of my projects, my resume, and find out
  	    more about me. This website is open source and can be viewed on my GitHub page. It is built from scratch
	    primarily on top of the NodeJS environment and the Express web framework. Please feel free
	    to contact me with any questions, comments, or employment opportunities.</p>
